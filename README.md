# Pydoku
A GUI-Based sudoku puzzle solver and generator built on Python 3 with tkinter.

This program utilizes a recursive backtracking solution algorithm as well as other sudoku solving algorithms to increase efficiency from the basic backtracking solution. Users have the option to enter an unsolved board using the arrow keys and the program will show a solution if one exists. Alternatively, the user can ask the program to generate an easy, medium, or hard sudoku puzzle. All puzzles generated are guaranteed to have exactly one solution. Then, the program can display the solution to the generated puzzle so the user can check the solution.
